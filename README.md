### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance software engineer for web applications with years of experience. My
biggest strength is being able to mediate between non-technical shareholders and
development teams.

At the age of 15, I founded my first own company and started developing web-based software
for schools which is still being sold. Being a developer, product owner and business owner
in one for almost 15 years leaves me with an outstanding experience in product management
of complex web applications. Since then, I work together with clients to redesign their
business processes through digitalization.

I like to conquer business cases from a user&apos;s perspective. Having an eye for edge
cases in user stories and finding practical solutions to them is a particular strength of
mine. I design backends with an API-first approach and have profound knowledge on REST and
GraphQL best practices, as well as security considerations and open standards like
OAuth&nbsp;2.0 for authentication.
